# afroengineer

Hi, my name is Kristian Toole and I am an aspiring roboticist. Afroengineer.com is my way of documenting my robotics projects on my journey towards becoming a skilled robotics research engineer. Enjoy!

My current robotics project is titled PROJECT T.R.A.C.I. TRACI stands for The Robotic Apparatus of Canine Intelligence. It is my attempt to create an intelligent robotic dog that moves and acts as closely to a real dog as possible. One of my main motivations for building it is my dog Sabrina who had been with me from when I was born until I turned fifteen years old. I miss her a ton.
